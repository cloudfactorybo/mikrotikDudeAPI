Mikrotik Dude API 

This is a project to create an API for the Dude by Mikrotik, cheating the way that adds and removes devices and links, mostly created because there isnt a way to interact with the dude via CLI or API or mostly are basic access to the Dude.

The basic flow of operations of the api is to have an Windows Agent who can login to a Dude Server and act as a middleware for the API.
